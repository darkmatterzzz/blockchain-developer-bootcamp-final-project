### General idea

*TL;DR;* Help kids to save and invest while parents can guide and choose where profits/rewards go. 

I want to create a fun experience for kids (and the family) to get into crypto and create an enjoyable experience of saving and investing. I'd do this by building an app that revolves around a candy factory where they make [marshmallows] (or something else?). Parents can build good habits by rewarding their children with $CNDY. 

The underlying contracts would enable parents, kids, and the whole family to build candy factories that enable them to stake $CNDY, earn $CNDY and mint NFT's ( to build CNDYchains ) that have special capabilities in the ecosystem.

Parents have an option to tell how $CNDY should be invested. For example: 

- Parent funds child's account each month with an amount of $CNDY.
- Parent can choose:
    - how much $CNDY is locked until a specific date or after a determined timeframe
    - how much $CNDY is freely available â€” for kid to use ( send over to spendable crypto card or something? ) , to play games, ...
    - how $CNDY rewards should be redistributed:
        - Keep $CNDY
        - Trade for another coin ( this would enable a parent to setup a savings account that automatically diversifies the child's portfolio and of course profit more)

### Example walkthrough:

- Parent deposits ETH, USDT, ... and receives $CNDY
- Parent builds a factory to stake more $CNDY ( and save for IRL item of some sorts? )
- Parent configures the factory on what to do with the $CNDY, keep, give to kids, invest, free available (let kid choose how to spend, invest, learn together?)
- Kid receives $CNDY in account
- Kid can buy factories (invest) with $CNDY
- Kid can spend $CNDY (trade to USDT or stable, and buy stuff via spendable crypto card or something? )

### Example stuff you want to learn kids:

- Game to how teach them put toys and equipment away.
- Game to throw marshmallow in a moving bowl
- ...
